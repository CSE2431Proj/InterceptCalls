#####README#######

Running the "make" command from this directory will compile all of our programs.

Running "make clean" will remove the object files created and other files associated with make

###Shell and Client(command sender)#####
To test the shell, make the ShellSocket folder the working directory and use the following commands :
the command for the shell is  ./shellhideMe

the command to send a message to the server is ./clienthideMe from within the "ShellSocket" directory

the shell will display a "client connected" message, press enter to execute the stored command 
 
sending the command "exit" from the client kills the server and the shell

#######Hiding Files #########
To hide the shell and kernel module use the command ./Infect.sh 

 (WARNING!!!: LINE 166 in "lkm\infection.c" MUST BE COMMENTED OUT FOR THE SYSTEM TO RECOVER NORMALLY!!!) LINE IS COMMENTED OUT BY DEFAULT . MUST UNCOMMENT TO REMOVE FROM LSMOD LIST

To recover the system use the command ./Purge.sh 

When the system is "infected" any file or folder with the prefix or containing the substring "hideMe" will be hidden from sight but still accessable.


####Test commands for debugging #####

the command to see the current message in shared memory is ./sharehideMe

to clear the current message use ./delhideMe

We did not manage to build a main program to install everything and do the hiding automatically. 

###########FOR COMPILATION ERRORS!!!#######
For the readline package if needed: 

#sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev
